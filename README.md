# Pizza Restaurant

This example is mimicing the process of customers ordering a pizza and adding toppings without out knowing exactly what is happening behind the scene.
In my exmple, the client/customer is in the Main. Just an object of class Restaurant was instantiated to call `GetCustomerOrder ()` to process the customer order.
