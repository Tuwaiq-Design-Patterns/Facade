# Facade ðŸ—³

Facade or (faÃ§ade) is a desgin pattren. The idea is to use an object as a front-facing interface that masking more complex structural code.

# Example

How do you turn on the computer? "Hit the power button" you say! That is what you believe because you are using a simple interface that computer provides on the outside, internally it has to do a lot of stuff to make it happen. This simple interface to the complex subsystem is a facade and I took this example and implement it using facade pattren ðŸ˜Š.
